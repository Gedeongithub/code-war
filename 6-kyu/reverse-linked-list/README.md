<h2><a href=https://www.codewars.com/kata/52f6be83172a8ba0be000342/train/javascript target="_blank">Reverse linked list</a></h2><h3>6 kyu</h3><p>Let's say we have a singly linked list.<br>Empty list is represented by <code>null</code> or equivalent (<code>nil</code> in Ruby).<br>Non-empty list is represented by 2-element array <code>[value, tail]</code>.</p><p>So for example list with values 1, 2, 3 would be represented as <code>[1, [2, [3, null]]]</code>.</p><p>Your job is to develop function <code>reverseList</code> which returns elements of given list in reverse order without modification of the original list.</p><p>P.S. Make sure your solution works on huge lists.</p>
