<h2><a href=https://www.codewars.com/kata/531489f2bb244a5b9f00077e/train/javascript target="_blank">Undo/Redo</a></h2><h3>4 kyu</h3><p>The purpose of this kata is to implement the <code>undoRedo</code> function.</p><p>This function takes an object and returns an object that has these actions to be performed on the object passed as a parameter:</p><p><code>set(key, value)</code> Assigns the value to the key. If the key does not exist, creates it.</p><p><code>get(key)</code> Returns the value associated to the key.</p><p><code>del(key)</code> removes the key from the object.</p><p><code>undo()</code> Undo the last operation (set or del) on the object. Throws an exception if there is no operation to undo.</p><p><code>redo()</code> Redo the last undo operation (redo is only possible after an undo). Throws an exception if there is no operation to redo.</p><p>After <code>set()</code> or <code>del()</code> are called, there is nothing to redo.</p><p>All actions must affect to the <code>object</code> passed to <code>undoRedo(object)</code> function. So you can not work with a copy of the object.</p><p>Any <code>set/del</code> after an <code>undo</code> should disallow new <code>redos</code>.</p>
