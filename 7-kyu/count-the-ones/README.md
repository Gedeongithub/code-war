There are several algorithms for efficient computing of the Hamming weight for numbers. In this Kata, speaking technically, you have to find out the number of '1' bits in a binary representation of a number. Thus,</p><pre style="display: none;"><code class="language-ruby"><span class="cm-variable">hamming_weight</span>(<span class="cm-number">10</span>) <span class="cm-comment"># 1010  =&gt; 2</span><span class="cm-variable">hamming_weight</span>(<span class="cm-number">21</span>) <span class="cm-comment"># 10101 =&gt; 3</span></code></pre><pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="cm-variable">hammingWeight</span>(<span class="cm-number">10</span>) <span class="cm-comment">// 1010  =&gt; 2</span><span class="cm-variable">hammingWeight</span>(<span class="cm-number">21</span>) <span class="cm-comment">// 10101 =&gt; 3</span></code></pre><p>The interesting part of this task is that you have to do it <em>without</em> string operation (hey, it's not really interesting otherwise)</p><p> ;)</p>
